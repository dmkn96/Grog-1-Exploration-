# Step 0 : Installation
### Hello everyone.

- [x] I placed the downloaded weights into the correct directory.<br>
`\checkpoints\ckpt-0` <br>
- [x] Changed the run(main_parameters) to circumvent the mesh issue:<br>
`ValueError: Number of devices 1 must equal the product of mesh_shape (1, 8)` <br>
solution -> Change (1, 8) -> (1, 1)  `# If you have one GPU`<br>
- [x] Everything seemed fine, but then I encountered this error:<br>
`FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/dev/shm/tmpva2uzbug'` <br>
solution -> Edit checkpoint.py -> <br>
```
@contextlib.contextmanager
def copy_to_shm(file: str):
    tmp_dir = tempfile.gettempdir()
    fd, tmp_path = tempfile.mkstemp(dir=tmp_dir)
    try:
        shutil.copyfile(file, tmp_path)
        yield tmp_path
    finally:
        os.close(fd)
        os.remove(tmp_path)

# Step 1 : Testing 
I launched the model and fixed all the bugs. <br>
However, I can't fully run it on my machine. üòû<br><br>
I've read forums where people mention the need for server-grade hardware.<br>
At minimum, 100GB of RAM and 5 video cards with more than 8GB of memory each.<br><br>
The best option would be to wait for a lighter version with fewer parameters. ‚≠ê<br>
